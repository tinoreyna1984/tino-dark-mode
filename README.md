# Dark mode with Next.js + TailwindCSS

## Features

It's a pretty simple landing page that has a dark mode toggle button. Unlike many other projects, this works with the dark mode functionality from scratch (i.e. does not require any npm library) using React concepts and the dark mode properties that are included in Tailwind.

## Installation

Use the following commands:

```bash
# Clone from GitHub repo:
git clone 

# Install the project and its addons
npm i

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Easily at Vercel.
